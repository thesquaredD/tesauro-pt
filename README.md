First, you'll have to setup your own project with [supabase](https://app.supabase.com).


Next, create a `.env` file in which you must create the following variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` which you'll find in `Settings` > `API` > `Project URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` which you'll find in `Settings` > `API` > `Project API keys`
- `DATABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` which you'll find in `Settings` > `Database` > `Connection string` > `URI`

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

and, finally, run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
``` -->
